🔎 Reconnaissance

Full TCP port scan:

nmap -p- --open --min-rate 5000 -sS -vvv -n -Pn 172.17.0.2 -oG allPorts
Scan Explanation

-p- → Scan all ports

--open → Show only open ports

--min-rate 5000 → Faster packet sending

-sS → SYN stealth scan

-vvv → Verbose output

-n → Disable DNS resolution

-Pn → Treat host as online

-oG → Grepable output

Open Ports Discovered

22 → SSH

80 → HTTP

🌐 Web Enumeration (Port 80)
